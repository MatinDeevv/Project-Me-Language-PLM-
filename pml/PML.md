# PML (Project Me Language)

PML is a tiny, practical DSL whose purpose is to **describe large, long-lived software systems** at a higher level than Python, while still compiling into **plain Python**.

## Design goals
- Human-readable enough to review, but structured enough for the agent to transform.
- Compiles into Python packages with tests.
- Encourages explicit modules, interfaces, and contracts.
- Keeps files minimal (prefer a few well-named modules over file explosions).

## Core concepts
- **Unit**: a module or component.
- **Contract**: interface + invariants.
- **Pipeline**: ordered execution phases.
- **Step**: atomic iteration task the agent executes.

## Step JSON format
`pml/steps.json` is the agent’s work queue.
Each item is:
```json
{
  "id": "runtime-0001",
  "phase": "runtime",
  "title": "Scaffold runtime",
  "body": "What to build/change and acceptance criteria",
  "status": "todo"
}
```

## Runtime principle
The agent should:
1. Read current workspace.
2. Execute exactly one step.
3. Save progress immediately.
4. Auto-generate new steps when queue is empty.

## Syntax Sketch

### Modules
```pml
module my_module {
  // module contents
}
```

### Contracts
```pml
contract my_contract {
  interface {
    // function signatures
  }
  invariants {
    // pre/post conditions
  }
}
```

### Pipelines
```pml
pipeline my_pipeline {
  step1: module_a.do_something()
  step2: module_b.process(step1)
  step3: module_c.validate(step2)
}
```
